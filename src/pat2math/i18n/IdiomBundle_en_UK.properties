weTXT-0 = Let's review how to solve an equation
weTXT-1 = This equation is the same type we have seen before. Our goal is to isolate X on the left side of the equality, and to do that we subtract by 4 on both sides
weTXT-2 = Notice what we did here
weTXT-3 = We applied the inverse operation, we had 4 subtracting from X
weTXT-4 = Using reverse operation, I add 4 from both sides
weTXT-5 = This will always give zero added to the x of the left side of the equality
weTXT-6 = Tip
weTXT-7 = It is not necessary to write these first two steps, so we can remove them from the resolution
weTXT-8 = Tip
weTXT-9 = Following this tip, we have eliminated some steps and can go straight by applying the reverse operation on the other side.
weTXT-10 = All set!
weTXT-11 = We were able to solve the equation successfully.
weTXT-12 = Let's now see this other equation
weTXT-13 = Again, we want to isolate X from the left side.
weTXT-14 = To eliminate some steps, we will use the direct inverse operation on the right side
weTXT-15 = We will decrease 1 on the right side and delete the +1 on the left side.
weTXT-16 = Hey! Here we have a novelty!
weTXT-17 = We have the -X, but we are not looking for the value of -X, but of + X.
weTXT-18 = How to make the -X positive?
weTXT-19 = We can multiply it by -1, then it becomes + X.
weTXT-20 = But attention!
weTXT-21 = If we multiply -1 on the left side, we have to multiply on the right side as well.
weTXT-22 = Let's remember the rules of multiplication signs
weTXT-23 = In each of the following questions, select the alternative that you think is the right answer.
weTXT-24 = Hey! here is a very important news!
weTXT-25 = X has a coefficient.
weTXT-26 = What is a coefficient?
weTXT-27 = It is the number that multiplies X, in this case it is 2.
weTXT-28 = How do we get 2 out of here?
weTXT-29 = We follow the same principle of reverse operation, as we saw earlier.
weTXT-30 = The inverse operation of multiplication is division
weTXT-31 = So we should move 2 to the other side by dividing 10.
weTXT-32 = But beware!
weTXT-33 = The signal of 2 does not change, it remains as a positive number. The signal is only modified when we work with addition and subtraction, where the inverse operation changes the signal.
weTXT-34 = Note that by dividing 2 on the right side, we are also dividing the 2 on the right side
weTXT-35 = But as we did before, we can apply the reverse operation directly, so we do not need to go through this step
weTXT-36 = All set!
weTXT-37 = When resolving the division on the right side, we find the value of X and finalize the resolution of the equation.
weTXT-38 = Let's now see this other equation
weTXT-39 = Note that X has a negative coefficient.
weTXT-40 = Using the inverse operation, we pass the -3 to the other side dividing the 15
weTXT-41 = Be aware: the negative sign must be preserved
weTXT-42 = We're done!
weTXT-43 = Remember that dividing a positive number by a negative yields a negative number
weTXT-44 = Hey! Here we have another news!
weTXT-45 = Let's work with fractions for the first time.
weTXT-46 = The incognito X is in a fraction
weTXT-47 = We can also say that X has a fractional coefficient, the number 1/4.
weTXT-48 = How do we get 4 out of here?
weTXT-49 = We follow the same principle of reverse operation, as we saw earlier.
weTXT-50 = The inverse operation of the division is the multiplication
weTXT-51 = So we have to move 4 to the other side by multiplying 20.
weTXT-52 = All set!
weTXT-53 = By solving the multiplication on the right side, we find the value of X and finalize the resolution of the equation.
weTXT-54 = Attention now!
weTXT-55 = This equation is a bit different from the previous ones because we are working with a negative denominator.
weTXT-56 = In this case we will also apply the inverse operation
weTXT-57 = We only have to take care to keep the negative sign of -6 by passing it to the other side of the equation
weTXT-58 = Using the inverse operation, we pass the -6 to the other side multiplying the 42	//obsolete
weTXT-59 = Now we have only to solve the multiplication 42 * (-6)	//obsolete
weTXT-60 = All set!	//obsolete
weTXT-61 = We were able to solve the equation successfully.	//obsolete
weTXT-62 = Hey, here is a very important news!
weTXT-63 = This is the default format of first-order equations.
weTXT-64 = Note that we will need to apply more than one type of reverse operation
weTXT-65 = We have a multiplication in X followed by a subtraction.
weTXT-66 = Let's start with the inverse operation of subtraction, which is addition
weTXT-67 = So we passed the -10 to the other side, inverting its signal.
weTXT-68 = Solving the right-hand sum, we get the number 18
weTXT-69 = Now, our next step is to isolate the incognito X.
weTXT-70 = Using the inverse multiplication operation, we pass 4 to the other side, dividing the 18
weTXT-71 = Caution: we are working with multiplication and division, so 4 must remain with the same (positive) signal.
weTXT-72 = We can simplify this fraction by dividing by 2 up and down
weTXT-73 = Thus we arrive at the final result of the equation.
weTXT-74 = Let's solve this equation now?
weTXT-75 = This equation is very similar to the previous one, however X has a negative coefficient and the term on the right side is also negative.
weTXT-76 = Please note that you will also need to apply more than one type of reverse operation
weTXT-77 = We have a multiplication in X followed by an addition.
weTXT-78 = So, we pass +9 to the other side inverting its signal.
weTXT-79 = Assim, passamos o +9 para o outro lado invertendo o seu sinal.
weTXT-80 = Solving the subtraction on the right side, we get the number -36
weTXT-81 = Now, our next step is to isolate the incognito X.
weTXT-82 = In order to eliminate a few steps, let's pass the -3 direct by dividing the -36 on the other side
weTXT-83 = Remember that the negative sign must be preserved.
weTXT-84 = Remember that dividing two negative numbers results in a positive number
weTXT-85 = All set! We have successfully solved the equation.
weTXT-86 = Oops, here we have another news!
weTXT-87 = Let's work for the first time with expressions involving more than one X term.
weTXT-88 = In this case, we can say that we have similar terms that can be added or subtracted
weTXT-89 = They are: 5x, -2x e x
weTXT-90 = Let's start by solving the subtraction on the left side
weTXT-91 = When we have a difference of similar terms, we keep the unknown X and subtract its coefficients.
weTXT-92 = In this equation, we have 5x - 2x = (5 - 2)x = 3x
weTXT-93 = The next step is to get +8 from here.
weTXT-94 = The reverse operation for addition is subtraction
weTXT-95 = So we passed +8 to the other side by reversing its signal.
weTXT-96 = Now we can solve the subtraction we have on the right side
weTXT-97 = At the same time we could pass +x, but let's take it one step at a time
weTXT-98 = The inverse operation also holds for terms as a function of X
weTXT-99 = In this way, we pass the + x to the left side by inverting its signal
weTXT-100 = By solving the 3x - x subtraction, we obtain 2x
weTXT-101 = We are almost finished solving this equation
weTXT-102 = Using the inverse operation, we pass the 2 to the other side, dividing the other number 2
weTXT-103 = Remember that we must preserve its positive sign.
weTXT-104 = Done!
weTXT-105 = Simplifying the fraction, we find the result 1 and conclude the development of the equation.
weTXT-106 = We present the distributive equations
weTXT-107 = These equations are easier than they seem. Let's explain step-by-step for you to understand right
weTXT-108 = What is distributive property?
weTXT-109 = It is a property of multiplication that tells us that, in the multiplication of any numbers, we can convert any of them into a sum or subtraction that the result will remain the same
weTXT-110 = Let's give an example in practice
weTXT-111 = Consider the multiplication 5 * 7 = 35. There are several ways of writing the number 7 in the form of addition or subtraction, one of which is 4 + 3
weTXT-112 = Thus we have 5(4 + 3) = 35
weTXT-113 = As we are working with defined numbers, the easiest option would be to add first 4 + 3, and then multiply by 5
weTXT-114 = What would be the other way to solve it?
weTXT-115 = We can distribute this multiplication in a sum of products. This distribution is carried out in two steps
weTXT-116 = First step (example 5(4 + 3) = 35)
weTXT-117 = Multiply the number that is outside the parentheses by the first term inside the parentheses. In this example we have 5 * 4
weTXT-118 = Second step (example 5(4 + 3) = 35)
weTXT-119 = Multiply the number that is outside the parentheses by the second term inside the parentheses, holding the sign of the expression (in our example it is the plus sign), so we have 5 * 4 + 5 * 3
weTXT-120 = Now just calculate the new expression
weTXT-121 = We have 5 * 4 = 20 and 5 * 3 = 15. Adding the two results we have 20 + 15 = 35, exactly the value of the multiplication 5 * 7
weTXT-122 = Let's apply the concepts learned in our equation
weTXT-123 = Let's start with the first distributive property, which is 5(2 + x). Even when working with unknowns, the rules do not change
weTXT-124 = First step
weTXT-125 = Multiply the number that is outside the parentheses by the first term inside the parentheses. In this case we have 5 * 2
weTXT-126 = Second step
weTXT-127 = Multiply the number that is outside the parentheses by the second term inside the parentheses, keeping the sign of the expression (in our example it is the plus sign), so we have 5 * 2 + 5x
weTXT-128 = Now we will do the same thing in the next distributive property
weTXT-129 = Do not forget that as we are working with equations, we need to rewrite the left side to maintain equality
weTXT-130 = Let's try to solve the two steps in one single step?
weTXT-131 = Remembering the instructions: Multiply the number that is outside the parentheses by the first term inside the parentheses. Then multiply the number that is outside the parentheses by the second term inside the parentheses, holding the sign of the expression
weTXT-132 = In this way, we have: 4(2x - 3) = 4 * 2x - 4 * 3
weTXT-133 = Note that the only difference from the first expression is that we have a subtraction. In this case, just replace the plus sign with the minus sign
weTXT-134 = Now we have resolved all pending multiplications
weTXT-135 = When you are more familiar with the distributive property, you can even calculate the two multiplications directly. Note: 4(2x - 3) = 8x - 12
weTXT-136 = Now we have an equation already known from the previous class plan
weTXT-137 = It is a first-degree equation with multiple terms
weTXT-138 = We pass the terms as a function of X to the left side, and the other numbers to the right side
weTXT-139 = Remember the rule of inverse operations: If we have an addition of one side, we will have a subtraction of the other. If we have a multiplication of one side, we will have a division of the other
weTXT-140 = We have 5x - 8x = - 3x and -12 - 10 = -22
weTXT-141 = Notice that both sides of the equation are negative. Do you remember that multiplication by -1 that we use several times in the second class plan? We can apply it here also to facilitate our calculation
weTXT-142 = Multiplying by - 1 the two sides of the equation, both become positive
weTXT-143 = Now you only need to move the 3 to the right side by dividing the 22 to complete the resolution
weTXT-144 = We're done!
weTXT-145 = Note that the fraction-result is already in its irreducible format, so we do not need to simplify it. And do not worry if you forget some step of the distributive property: You can ask for tips at any time or even check this exercise again
weTXT-146 = Let's solve this equation now
weTXT-147 = Notice that there is an equality of fractions. This equality is called reason and proportion
weTXT-148 = How do we solve reason and proportion?
weTXT-149 = Basically we will use the rule of inverse division operation twice, but before that, let's take a closer look at our equation.
weTXT-150 = Did you realize that the fraction on the right side can be simplified?
weTXT-151 = We can divide by 100 its numerator and denominator, which will make it much easier for the next step
weTXT-152 = Now notice the terms highlighted in green and blue
weTXT-153 = They are the denominators of the two fractions, and from them we will apply the inverse operation rule. You may have noticed that the unknown X is in a denominator, but we will see in the next step that this will not be a problem
weTXT-154 = We know that the inverse operation of division is multiplication
weTXT-155 = Thus, we can pass the first denominator to the other side by multiplying the numerator of the second fraction, and vice versa. Caution: The second denominator was negative.When we work with multiplication and division, the signal is preserved
weTXT-156 = Now we solve the multiplications: 10 * (-6) = -60 and 5 * x = 5x
weTXT-157 = Note that the incognito X is on the right side of the equation. Since it is a simple equality of two terms, we can change them from side to side without modifying any operation or sign
weTXT-158 = We are almost there
weTXT-159 = Now we only need to divide -60 by 5, which is the coefficient of X
weTXT-160 = Notice that the numbers 60 and 5 are multiples of each other
weTXT-161 = Therefore, we can simplify this fraction and arrive at a whole number as a result
weTXT-162 = We're done!
weTXT-163 = Always remember three things when you solve reasons and proportions:<br>1º) Check if it is possible to simplify one or both fractions to facilitate calculation;<br>2º) You will always pass the denominators to the other sides by multiplying the numerators;<br>3º) The numerators may be composed of an addition or subtraction expression, such as 2x + 3. In this case, multiplication must be performed in the two terms of this expression
weTXT-164 = Attention now!
weTXT-165 = Let's work for the first time with equations involving addition and subtraction of fractions with different denominators
weTXT-166 = The first step is the application of the Common Minimum Minimum (MMC) in all denominators
weTXT-167 = Remember that the denominators are the bottom numbers of fractions
weTXT-168 = What happens to terms that are not fractions?
weTXT-169 = We will have to consider them as a whole fraction. All integers can be represented as a fraction of denominator 1
weTXT-170 = This same rule is also valid for the variable X and its coefficient
weTXT-171 = In this equation, the integer terms are -10 and 5x. Thus we have -10/1 and -5x/1
weTXT-172 = Now let's calculate the Least Common Multiple of all denominators
weTXT-173 = So we have LCM (2, 4, 1, 1). You can do this calculation in the notebook or mentally if you already have more practice
weTXT-174 = Calculating the LCM (2, 4, 1, 1) we get the number 4
weTXT-175 = The next step is to apply a property to transform all the terms of the equation into integers
weTXT-176 = How does this property work?
weTXT-177 = It tells us that in order to transform a fraction into an integer, we divide the result of the MMC by its denominator, and then multiply by its numerator. CAUTION: This property uses concepts of reverse operation and can only be applied in equations
weTXT-178 = Let's check an example in practice
weTXT-179 = Note the first fraction (3x / 2) The result of the MMC in this exercise is 4, so we would have 4: 2 * 3x. Remember that PAT2Math does not allow this division operator, so we need to calculate divide and type directly 2 * 3x.
weTXT-180 = Now we apply this property in all terms of the equation
weTXT-181 = Caution: all signals must be preserved
weTXT-182 = The next step is to resolve all pending multiplications
weTXT-183 = Do you remember the rules of numerical expressions? Whenever we have a multiplication or division account, it must be solved first, in which case we have more than one account in these conditions and there are no parentheses, so we can solve all these multiplications at the same time. We just need to take care of the signs 
weTXT-184 = We arrived in a normal equation with multiple terms
weTXT-185 = As we are already more experienced in such equations, we can apply more than one property in a single step. In this exercise, we can join the similar terms 6x - x and adjust the other terms in that already known way: terms involving X on the left side, other numbers on the right side. We just need to take care to correctly apply reverse operations
weTXT-186 = We're almost there
weTXT-187 = Now only the last rule of reverse operation is needed
weTXT-188 = Using the inverse multiplication operation, we pass the -15 to the other side by dividing the 40
weTXT-189 = Remember: when working with reverse operations of multiplication and division, the signal is preserved.
weTXT-190 = Are we finished?
weTXT-191 = Not yet.Note that the numbers 40 and -15 are multiples of each other, so we can still simplify this fraction.You remember the divisibility criteria? o of 5 is as follows: any number that ends in 5 or in 0 it is divisible by 5. Thus we can divide by 5 the numerator and the denominator of that fraction, and we will put the result in the next step
weTXT-192 = Now we're done!
weTXT-193 = The number 8 does not end in 5 or 0, so we have reached the final step of simplification and solved the equation successfully
weTXT-194 = Welcome!
weTXT-195 = PAT2Math is a program that helps solving algebraic equations. <br> Let's check out some basic concepts before starting
weTXT-196 = What is our purpose
weTXT-197 = Discover the value of X.
weTXT-198 = What is to determine the value of X
weTXT-199 = To find the number that causes both sides of the equality to be of the same value
weTXT-200 = How do we find out the value of X?
weTXT-201 = We have to isolate X, that is, leave X alone on one side of the equation.
weTXT-202 = How do we isolate X?
weTXT-203 = Making 2 get out of here and move it to the other side of equality.
weTXT-204 = How do I get 2 out of here?
weTXT-205 = I can decrease by -2, which gives 0: 2-2 = 0
weTXT-206 = But attention! 
weTXT-207 = If I decrease 2 on the left side, I have to decrease 2 on the other side to stay equal.
weTXT-208 = The expression "+0" is no longer required;
weTXT-209 = So we can remove it in the next step.
weTXT-210 = Done! 
weTXT-211 = We were able to isolate X. Now we only have to solve subtraction 10 - 2.
weTXT-212 = We're done!
weTXT-213 = Now, let's check out some basic PAT2Math functions.
weTXT-214 = Let's solve this equation now?
weTXT-215 = We are going to reapply the reverse operation.But beware: the inverse operation of subtraction is addition.
weTXT-216 = Let's solve this equation now?
weTXT-217 = Remember that the goal is to subtract the -4 by adding it to another number whose result gives zero.
weTXT-218 = Let's now look at this other equation
weTXT-219 = The 4 is adding to X.
weTXT-220 = To eliminate some steps, we will use the direct inverse operation on the right side
weTXT-221 = So, let's decrease 4 on the other side
weTXT-222 = Attention
weTXT-223 = Note that we already had a negative number on the right side of the equality.
weTXT-224 = But the resolution is similar
weTXT-225 = The difference is that we will have to operate with a negative number.
weTXT-226 = Attention now!
weTXT-227 = Let's get back to working with the reverse operation of subtraction.
weTXT-228 = To eliminate some steps, we will use the direct inverse operation on the right side
weTXT-229 = The inverse of the subtraction is the sum, so let's add 3 on the right and delete the -3 on the left.
weTXT-230 = All set!
weTXT-231 = We were able to solve the equation successfully.
weTXT-232 = Attention now!
weTXT-233 = Let's get back to working with the reverse operation of subtraction.
weTXT-234 = As we did in the previous equations, we will use the direct inverse operation on the right side
weTXT-235 = Let's add 10 on the right side and delete the -10 on the left side.
weTXT-236 = Note that we have a negative X again
weTXT-237 = To solve this problem, let's multiply the two sides of the equation by -1.
weTXT-238 = Remember the rules of the signs
weTXT-239 = Less times less gives plus, and plus times less gives less.
weTXT-240 = We're done!
weTXT-241 = We were able to solve the equation successfully.
weTXT-242 = Let's solve this equation now?
weTXT-243 = We will reapply the reverse operation, this time of addition.
weTXT-244 = Our goal is to eliminate +4 from the left side
weTXT-245 = For this, let's subtract 4 from the left side.
weTXT-246 = Remember what we do now?
weTXT-247 = We have to multiply -1 on both sides to get the positive X.
weTXT-248 = Recalling the Rules of Signals
weTXT-249 = We have negative numbers on both sides of the equation, and less times less gives plus
weTXT-250 = All set!
weTXT-251 = We were able to solve the equation successfully.
weTXT-252 = Let's now look at this other equation
weTXT-253 = Please note that all terms are negative.
weTXT-254 = The inverse operation of subtraction is the sum
weTXT-255 = So we added 15 on the right side to eliminate the -15 on the left side.
weTXT-256 = Now we have the -X
weTXT-257 = But remember we want to find out the value of + X.
weTXT-258 = Again we have a set of signs
weTXT-259 = Do you remember the rules? If we have a multiplication of equal signs, we have more in the end<br>If we have a multiplication of different signals, we have less at the end
weTXT-260 = We're done!
weTXT-261 = We were able to solve the equation successfully.
weTXT-262 = Let's solve this equation now?
weTXT-263 = Note that this equation also has a coefficient.
weTXT-264 = Using the inverse operation, we pass 5 to the other side by dividing the -30
weTXT-265 = Remember that your signal should not be changed.
weTXT-266 = Attention now!
weTXT-267 = We divide a negative number by a positive number.
weTXT-268 = The multiplication sign rule is also valid for division
weTXT-269 = Thus, the division of numbers of the same signals results in a positive number. On the other hand, the division of numbers of different signals results in a negative number.
weTXT-270 = All set!
weTXT-271 = When resolving the division on the right side, we find the value of X and finalize the resolution of the equation.
weTXT-272 = Attention now!
weTXT-273 = All terms in the equation are negative.

weTXT-277 = Do you remember the rule of signs? the division of two negative numbers results in a positive number.
weTXT-278 = Let's solve this equation now
weTXT-279 = This equation is very similar to the previous one, however we are going to work with a negative number.
weTXT-280 = Using reverse operation, we pass 7 to the other side multiplying the -49
weTXT-281 = Remember that your positive sign must be preserved
weTXT-282 = We're done!

weTXT-284 = You have chosen to keep the negative sign in X
weTXT-285 = Here are the steps to resolve this:
weTXT-286 = Using the inverse operation, we passed 6 to the other side multiplying 42
weTXT-287 = Notice that we have kept the minus sign, leaving the negative X
weTXT-288 = Do you remember how we do to make X positive?
weTXT-289 = We only have to multiply the two sides of equality by -1.
weTXT-290 = Done!
weTXT-291 = Now we only have to solve these multiplications to complete the resolution of the equation.
weTXT-292 = We're done!
weTXT-293 = We have successfully solved the equation.
weTXT-294 = Using the inverse operation, we passed 6 to the other side multiplying 42
